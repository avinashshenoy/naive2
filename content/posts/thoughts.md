It's *finally* here! A place for my thoughts on the world of finance. Okay, perhaps not the whole world of finance but my world of finance. I have been mulling starting this space since the middle of last year. Procastination, lazyness, work.. I can make all sort of excuses for why it took this long but that's the past. It's finally deployed.

__Naive Investor__.. Why _Naive_ you may ask? While i was trying to find an appropriate domain name towards the end of last year, my initial few choices where already taken. And then the work Naive popped into my head. One of the definitions that Marriam Websters dictionary defines [Naive](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/naive) as
> SELF-TAUGHT\
> produced by or as if by a self-taught artist

_Nailed it_, it thought to myself. That probably is the best description of who I consider myself to be. I'm a self thought amateur investor. That's me! So _Naive Investor_ it was.

As an amateur investor who is still learning daily about the world of finance, I have made some silly decisions.. a few of them were harmless while others definitely impacted my portfolio. I'm still learning from those mistakes and it takes a bit of work to turn them into muscle memory. 

It occurred to me that some of these learning could be useful to others. And so _Naive Investor_ was born. A space for me to share my learning when it comes to investments and the world of finance. What it won't be a space to recommend investment ideas. I won't pretend to know what is a good investment because i don't, period! 

What I hope to share are interesting facts that cross my eye during my journey in our world of finance. And I hope that others find it interesting as well.
